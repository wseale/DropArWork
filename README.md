# Security Cam for Paradrop

Security Camera Chute

## Category: Security, Computer Vision

Requirements:
* Wireless security cam that can connect to the Paradrop router.

## Description:

A motion detection system using a webcam to capture differing images.  Everything is kept within the router, with nothing getting sent to the cloud.
* Configure JSON with ports "80":"5000","81":"81","8010":"8010"
* Configure the webcam to connect to the SSID and dhcp, disable authentication for images.

##Files

* Dockerfile: Uses apache2, nodejs, python-imaging, iptables
* seccam.py: Takes in three arguments for caliberation, time and sensitivity. According to these parameter, the security camera takes pictures each time it [detects motion](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/_modules/PIL/ImageChops.html) and saves it on the router for future reference.
* run.sh

## Getting Started

1. Fork this project to your own github account.
2. seccamp.py is the main file where the functionality of motion detection lies. [httplib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html) is used for getting the file handle.
3. Change the run.sh for tweaking the parameters.

When creating a version of this chute, you should configure it as
shown in the image.  Your camera will be pre-configured to connect to a
certain ESSID, which you should enter in the form.  You will be given
this information during the workshop.  Also, be sure to add the three
port bindings as shown.
